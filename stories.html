										<h2>Dina - Romania</h2>

										<p>Dina come to New York from Romania when she was 11 years old. Things were pretty bad in Romania during that time, it was a communist country under Russian rule and Dina's aunt received her mother and her here. The environment was very scary, the military and spies were everywhere and it was extremly hard to leave the country. Dina's parents tried to leave for more than 10 years and unfortunatly her father didn't make it.</p>

                      <p>Coming here it was quite a shock but Dina tried to make the most out of it, in school she quickly learned english and got new friends, it was easier for her than for others, "I think it is a matter of personality, I'm an adjuster. To be honest I didn't miss Romania that much, my only struggle was grades. I was used to being the best of my class, and here I had a harder time" The one thing that stayed the same here was food, Dina's mom, as many other immigrants do, kept the same recipes they were used to eat back in Romania, this helped them feel more at home and preserve their culture. Here they could also be openly Jewish, which felt very liberating for them</p>

                      <p>Dina managed to go back for a visit a few years later as a young adult. Things were better now and she was able to visit her father's grave. But one of her biggest discoveries was abour her identity, she realized here everyone looked like her, she had never felt different in America but now she felt part of the Romanian people. </p>

    										<h2>Kal - Ethiopia</h2>

    										<p>Kal was born in a big city in Ethiopia, but only lived there until she was four years old. Her father was member of the opposing party and hed to fled to avoid persecution. He traveled here first and Kal and her mom followed. Kal was soon in school, and it was there where she was overwhelmed by racism. Going to a primarly white elementary school, she realized for the first time she was black. Back in Ethiopia that had never been an issue, but here, at the age of 7, she realized that being black was being different. Also communities were much tighter in Ethiopia. Families live together in compounds, here it felt really weird for her living in an apartment.</p>

    										<p>"I went back to Ethiopia a couple of years ago, I felt like I needed to go home. I spent time with my family and wnet to a monastery"</p>

    										<p>Kal soon returned to New York and is now in her Sophomore year in NYU. She has been able to create a dual identity and convines both cultures to make them her own. As immigrants this is usually complex, especially when both cultures are so different.

                        "I feel my values are more ethipian, but my behaviors are more American"</p>

        										<h2>Delia</h2>

        										<p>Delia is a sophomore in high school, but has lived a life quite different from her classmates. She was born in Guatemala, the second of 6 children, in a rural and poor neighborhood. Her older brother left home when she was young, but when she turned 16 she decided she wanted to go and live with him here in New York. It was hard con convince her parents, and even harder to get the money for the trip but she was determined to get a better education and help her family, especially her younger sisters. Visas are almost impossible to get in Guatemala so she had to travel by land to Mexico and cross the border through the desert. The journey was terrible,</p>

        										<p>"The worst part was once we were in th U.S, the desert was so hot, we had no food or water left and I was so afraid someone would find us" </p>

        										<p>Someone ment either the US migratory policy or the illegal gangs that travel the desert in look of illegal crossers. She find some friends along the way, other girls traveling alone, and they would take turns watching over while the other slept. She saw terrible thing in the way, children younger than her completly alone, dead bodies and dangerous animals. </p>

                            <p>"I cried every night, most of the people I was traveling with did it. We just wanted someone to find us, we didn't care anymore" </p>

                            <p>They were finally taken by the migratory police, sadly this led to a cold cell, a torture usually use in CIA interrogations, but which has been know to be use with illegal immigrants in the Mexico border. She was kept there for the night, and then when they realized she was underage she was transported to Washington. She lived in a detention facility, but was allowed to go to school and finally talk to her brother. After some weeks both of them reunited in New York and she started going to high school. The changes have been hard for her, her english is improving but she still needs to balance school and work, to help pay back her father for the trip. </p>

                            <p>Looking at Delia, now 1 year later, you would never imagine what she has been through. She is a happy and brave girl, with friends and a huge strenght to go on. She risked it all to be here and now plans to make the best out of it.</p>
